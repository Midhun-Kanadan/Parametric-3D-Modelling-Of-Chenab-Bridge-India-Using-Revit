# Parametric-3D-Modelling-Of-Chenab-Bridge-India-Using-Revit
The project idea is to create a parametric 3D model of a railway bridge using Revit, inspired by the recently inaugurated Chenab bridge, the world's highest railway bridge. The model will have parametric properties that can be interactively controlled using Dynamo, and will be used to design a 4D process animation based on a schedule within the tool desiteMD. Additionally, the model will be rendered in a realistic way to visualize the bridge design. The model will include steel piers and concrete piers as parametric families.
